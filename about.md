ï£¿ iOS developer from Moscow

I'm developing iOS apps for 4 years. In addition to development, I am fond of mobile UI/UX design. I also participated in various technological hackathons such as VK Hackahton and Junction. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rbth.com/science-and-tech/330454-wwdc-apple-russia-winners">I won an Apple WWDC Scholarship</a> and was one of 8 students from Russia who went to the WWDC 2019 conference for free. I love extreme sports: skiing, wakesurfing and many others. I travel often and write about it on my blog or social networks.
